# Plotting-Weather-Patterns
The highest and the lowest temperatures for each day of the year from 2005-2014 for Ann Arbor, Michigan are extracted using `pandas`. These temperatures were plotted as line-plots using `matplotlib`. Then the temperatures from year 2015, that were record breaking, were plotted as scatter-plots.

The data for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Daily Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt) (GHCN-Daily).

I did this project as a part of the course: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python on Coursera.
